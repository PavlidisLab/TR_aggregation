## This repo contains the code for "Characterizing the targets of transcription regulators by aggregating ChIP-seq and perturbation expression data sets"
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505909v2


A note about the structure/organization of the scripts, which follows the logic of the paper:

Multiple aspects of the analysis came from rounds of curation on google sheets, and drawing on data
available on the Pavlab servers that are not readily shareable (like the aligned signal tracks
for every ChIP-seq experiment). Summarized data and curated sheets used for analysis are provided 
wherever possible. Please reach out if there is additional information required.
