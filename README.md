## This repo contains the code for XXX.

A note about the structure/organization of the scripts, which follows the logic of the paper:

Multiple aspects of the analysis came from rounds of curation on google sheets, and drawing on data
available on the Pavlab servers that are not readily shareable (like the aligned signal tracks
for every ChIP-seq experiment). Summarized data and curated sheets used for analysis are provided 
wherever possible. Please reach out if there is additional information required.
